# Codex Quota Scheduler

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

`codex-quota-scheduler` is a dynamic library plugin for CLIProxyAPI (CPA). It
provides a quota-aware, optimized Fill First scheduler for Codex accounts, so
CPA selects accounts by real usability instead of relying on a static account
order alone.

## v0.3.1 Highlights

- Fixed a management-page crash introduced in v0.3.0: the settings form
  referenced a lifecycle-history input the template never rendered, so loading
  data threw "Cannot set properties of null" and hid the protected area. The
  retry-chain CPA confirmation block is rendered completely, the retry section
  stays hidden until data loads, and a template test now fails the build when
  any scripted element reference is missing.

## v0.3.0 Highlights

- Built on the CPA v7.3 plugin SDK (schema 6): raw-JSON management responses,
  official request lifecycle events, and the QuotaProvider interface exposing
  cached Codex quota to CPA management clients.
- Quota is now observed from real response streams: a strictly read-only
  stream-chunk interceptor parses `codex.rate_limits` frames, and successful
  usage records consume the host-normalized `X-Codex-*` snapshot. Observations
  refresh the cache, defer polling, and carry window-identity evidence into
  the temporary-exhaustion reconciliation. The UI shows each account's quota
  source.
- Temporary-exhaustion markers now clear automatically when a fresh quota read
  proves an actual upstream reset (window identity changed and every known
  window has capacity), in addition to real-request success and the
  operator-confirmed manual refresh. Same-window percentages alone still never
  clear anything.
- Optional per-model retry chain with failover (Live / Shadow / Always modes)
  for retryable upstream failures before any content is committed, ported from
  doer-ee's Codex Fleet Manager (MIT). Disabled by default.
- Schedule across CPA priority tiers: with `schedule_across_priorities`
  (default on) a lower tier is selected when every higher tier is exhausted,
  instead of delegating to the built-in scheduler.
- Opt-in managed quota disable and recovery lane (429 → CPA-level disable →
  read-only polling → verified re-enable) with credential-fingerprint
  ownership, ported from dos1989's fork (MIT) and hardened.
- Probe hardening from Siriussee's fork: ambiguous sends recover without an
  unrelated wake, and a mid-probe server-side compensating reset rebases the
  baseline instead of looping in AnomalyHold. The probe model moves to
  gpt-5.6-luna.
- Management UI: account pin toggle, remembered-key reveal on auth failure,
  per-account quota source, and managed-disable status.

## v0.2.2 Highlights

- Existing installations safely migrate their lazy-reset baselines; fresh
  installations observe the first confirmed lazy reset window before activation.
- While normal refresh is dormant, the opt-in Probe continues read-only
  observation at the quota refresh interval with a 30-minute minimum.
- A compact activation request is sent only after strict lazy-window evidence;
  after a confirmed reset, the window re-arms for the next cycle.
- Persisted state and per-window single-flight coordination preserve safe
  behavior across crashes and concurrent triggers.

## v0.2.0 Highlights

- Availability now comes before plugin priority: an unusable high-priority
  account can no longer outrank a usable account.
- Unavailable accounts are displayed by expected recovery time, earliest first,
  with unknown recovery times last.
- The five-hour quota window is optional. Accounts remain schedulable when
  OpenAI omits it, provided a valid weekly or monthly long window is present.
- A missing or invalid long window remains Unknown and unavailable, allowing CPA
  fallback instead of making an unsafe selection.
- The active Codex account list is synchronized from CPA's authoritative auth
  roster and restricted to the highest confirmed CPA auth-priority tier.
- Reset-window activation uses a persisted, single-flight sequence that verifies
  the result after one small Codex request. It remains opt-in.
- The Management UI queue follows the same availability classes and ordering
  rules as production selection.

## How Scheduling Works

The plugin owns account bindings using the standard CPA main plugin interfaces.
No CPA patch is needed. With `affinity_mode: fill-first` (default), a usable
binding survives priority and reset-aware ranking changes. The layers below
choose accounts for new bindings and failover. Requests without explicit
session IDs share a caller/API-key + provider-pool + normalized-model routing
binding. Configure `affinity_ttl` (default `4h`) in the plugin; these settings are
independent of CPA's built-in routing strategy and affinity settings. See
[reset-aware policy](docs/reset-aware-policy.md#affinity) for host compatibility,
retry behavior, and the distinction between queue order and existing bindings.

The scheduler applies four layers of decisions. Each layer narrows or orders the
accounts passed to the next one.

### 1. Admit the active CPA priority tier

- Only candidates whose provider is `codex` are considered. Other providers are
  ignored.
- A Codex account without an explicit CPA auth priority is treated as priority `0`.
- With `schedule_across_priorities` enabled (the default, and the mode the
  v7.3 host feeds with candidates from every tier), the plugin admits Codex
  accounts from all CPA priority tiers. Within the same availability class,
  higher tiers win for new bindings and failover. Ready accounts precede
  trial-eligible accounts regardless of tier. Lower tiers
  are also refreshed so their availability is known.
- With `schedule_across_priorities` disabled — or on hosts that only send the
  highest tier — the plugin admits exactly the highest confirmed tier and lower
  tiers stay under CPA's own fallback behavior.
- If all Codex accounts should participate together, give them the same CPA auth
  priority. Priority `0` is the simplest recommended configuration.

CPA auth priority and the plugin-owned account priority are separate settings.
The plugin never reads its account priority from CPA and never writes it back to
CPA.

### 2. Classify real availability

Admitted accounts are divided into three practical groups:

1. **Ready:** quota evidence is fresh or aging and the account is usable.
2. **Trial eligible:** evidence is unknown or stale but the account can be
   verified safely before use.
3. **Unavailable:** the long quota window is exhausted, authentication is
   blocked, the circuit is open, temporary exhaustion feedback is active, or
   the account cannot be verified safely.

Ready accounts are considered before trial-eligible accounts. Unavailable
accounts are not selected by the plugin.

A valid long window—weekly or monthly—is required. The five-hour window is optional:
if OpenAI temporarily omits it, a valid long window is enough for the
account to remain usable. If the long window is missing or invalid, the account
stays Unknown and unavailable so CPA fallback can take over.

When both long-window exhaustion and older temporary-exhaustion feedback are
present, the weekly or monthly exhaustion is authoritative and is shown as the
reason the account is unavailable.

### 3. Order selectable accounts

Plugin priority is applied only after availability classification, and only
inside the same selectable class. A higher plugin priority is considered first,
but it cannot move an unavailable account ahead of a usable one.

Within the same plugin priority:

1. If `monthly_mode` is `priority`, monthly accounts come before weekly
   accounts.
2. Accounts with higher quota pressure are preferred. Quota pressure is the
   remaining long-window percentage divided by the hours until that window
   resets, with a 30-minute minimum divisor.
3. Earlier expiry, then higher remaining quota, break ties when pressure is
   equal or unavailable.
4. The stable account ID order breaks the final tie.

With the default `monthly_mode: expiry_order`, weekly and monthly accounts share
the same combined remaining-quota/reset-pressure ordering. The alternative
`priority` mode explicitly prefers monthly accounts before applying pressure.

### 4. Order unavailable accounts

Plugin priority is ignored after an account becomes unavailable: priority
cannot make an exhausted account usable.

The Management queue orders unavailable accounts by expected recovery time from
earliest to latest. Accounts with no known recovery time appear last. This makes
the visible queue describe what can actually become usable next rather than
preserving an irrelevant priority order.

If neither the Ready nor trial-eligible group contains a safe choice, the plugin
returns no selection and allows CPA fallback.

### Example

Given four admitted Codex accounts, the visible and effective order is:

| Order | State | Plugin priority | Recovery | Why |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Ready | 10 | — | Highest priority among Ready accounts |
| 2 | Ready | 0 | — | Still usable, so it stays ahead of every unavailable account |
| 3 | Weekly quota exhausted | 100 | 2 hours | Unavailable; high priority is ignored and this is the earliest recovery |
| 4 | Exhausted or Unknown | 1000 | Later or unknown | Unavailable and expected to recover last |

## Quota Refresh And Reset-Window Activation

### Quota refresh

Quota refresh reads the current Codex quota state from ChatGPT. It does not send
an ordinary model request and does not need the Management page to remain open.

Quota data has two sources:

- **Response observation (preferred).** Every Codex response stream carries a
  `codex.rate_limits` event with the same window data as the quota endpoint,
  and successful usage records may carry the host-normalized `X-Codex-*`
  snapshot (WebSocket transport). The plugin registers a strictly read-only
  stream-chunk interceptor that watches for those frames, attributes them to
  the serving account, and refreshes its quota cache as a side effect of real
  traffic. An observation also defers that account's polling refresh and feeds
  the temporary-exhaustion reconciliation with evidence bound to an actual
  response. The interceptor never modifies, holds, or delays any stream byte.
- **Polling fallback.** Accounts without recent observations are refreshed from
  the generic quota endpoint on the usual cadence.

The Management UI shows each account's quota source (response observation vs
polled refresh).

During recent Codex activity, accounts are refreshed when their individual
deadlines become due; the worker does not repeatedly scan every account at a
fixed global interval. After the active window becomes idle, normal background
refresh sleeps until a Codex request, a management action, or a due reset-window
operation wakes it.

A `usage_limit_reached` response immediately marks the selected account
temporarily exhausted until its reported reset time, or for two minutes when no
reset time is provided. Quota exhaustion does not count as a circuit-breaker
failure. Repeated non-quota failures use the circuit breaker instead.

### Temporary-exhaustion recovery

The temporary-exhaustion marker is cleared only by verified evidence, never by
generic quota percentages alone:

- **A real successful request through the account** clears the marker
  immediately. A later `usage_limit_reached` response re-marks the account with
  a fresh reset time.
- **Any successful quota refresh clears the marker automatically when the fresh
  snapshot carries strict reset evidence:** every known window shows remaining
  capacity AND the five-hour window's reset deadline changed since the marker
  was recorded (an upstream reset mints a new window). Without a five-hour
  window, a usable long window that resets after the recorded deadline is
  accepted as weaker fallback evidence.
- **A manual per-account refresh from the Management UI** clears the marker when
  the fresh quota snapshot shows remaining capacity in every known window —
  even for a same-window full reading, because the operator explicitly
  confirmed an upstream reset. The manual action also overrides host-side
  `disabled`/`unavailable` cooldown flags, so an account can be refreshed after
  an operator-triggered upstream reset even while CPA still keeps its own
  cooldown.
- **Background refresh never clears the marker from same-window percentages
  alone.** The generic quota endpoint can report 100% remaining on the very
  window the 429 pointed at while model requests still hit upstream 429
  (observed on K12-plan credentials), so a same-window full reading without the
  window-identity change above is not recovery evidence.

### Managed quota disable and recovery (opt-in)

With `enable_managed_quota_disable` enabled, a confirmed `usage_limit_reached`
disables the account's CPA credential (`disabled: true` on the auth file) so
CPA itself stops routing to it. The plugin keeps a durable ownership record
(keyed by auth index, carrying the credential fingerprint) and re-enables the
account only after a fresh read-only quota check proves BOTH windows usable.

Safety rules:

- a manually disabled account is never adopted or re-enabled;
- recovery never enables from elapsed time alone;
- the ownership fingerprint must still match — a rotated credential under the
  same auth file is left for the operator;
- planned records interrupted by a crash are reconciled on the next pass;
- the feature is off by default because it writes host auth files.

The account cards show the managed-disable state and next check time.
Ported from dos1989's managed-quota-recovery fork (MIT) with the fingerprint
matching, five-hour-window evidence, and crash reconciliation added.

### Reset-window activation

OpenAI may report that a quota reset time has passed without creating the next
quota window until the account sends another Codex request. When automatic
reset-window activation is enabled, the plugin:

1. checks the quota again;
2. sends one tiny Codex request only if the new window is still missing;
3. verifies the quota afterward; and
4. persists the operation state so restart recovery verifies before retrying.

This feature is disabled by default because the activation request may consume
a small amount of quota. Concurrent triggers share one operation rather than
sending duplicate requests.

### When CPA cannot confirm the account list

Normal refresh and reset-window activation stop when CPA cannot confirm the
current Codex account list and priorities. The plugin can continue serving safe
management information while it retries roster synchronization.

The high-risk setting `probe_on_provisional_roster` permits reset-window
activation using the most recently saved account list during that condition.
Credentials are revalidated before each attempt, but the plugin still cannot
guarantee that an account was not removed or moved to another CPA priority tier.
Keep this setting disabled unless you understand and accept that risk.

## Installation

The recommended method is CPA's Plugin Store. Find **Codex Quota Scheduler**,
review the third-party plugin warning, and install the latest stable release.

For manual installation, download the archive for your platform from the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/JefferyZhang2019/cpa-plugin-codex-quota-scheduler/releases/latest):

```text
codex-quota-scheduler_<version>_<goos>_<goarch>.zip
```

Extract the library from the archive root and place it in CPA's matching plugin
directory:

- macOS: `codex-quota-scheduler.dylib`
- Linux and FreeBSD: `codex-quota-scheduler.so`
- Windows: `codex-quota-scheduler.dll`

Example:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/CLIProxyAPI/plugins/darwin/arm64
cp codex-quota-scheduler.dylib /path/to/CLIProxyAPI/plugins/darwin/arm64/
```

## CPA Configuration

Enable plugins globally and enable this plugin:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  configs:
    codex-quota-scheduler:
      enabled: true
      priority: 1 # CPA plugin registration/load priority
```

The registration/load `priority` above is not CPA account priority and is not
the plugin-owned per-account scheduler priority. Account annotations and
scheduler settings are managed from the plugin page rather than CPA's generic
plugin form.

Default scheduler settings:

```yaml
handle_enabled: true
quota_refresh_interval: 30m
stale_after: 5h
refresh_active_window: 1h
refresh_after_reset_delay: 1m
refresh_retry_delays: 1m,5m,15m
refresh_on_startup: false
monthly_mode: expiry_order
fallback: fill-first
enable_usage_feedback: true
enable_reset_probe: false
probe_on_provisional_roster: false
max_refresh_concurrency: 1
quota_endpoint: https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage
circuit_failure_threshold: 5
circuit_open_duration: 30m
circuit_half_open_success_threshold: 2
max_log_entries: 200
log_retention: 24h
```

`monthly_mode` accepts:

- `expiry_order`: use expiry-based ordering across weekly and monthly accounts.
- `priority`: prefer monthly accounts before weekly accounts within the same
  selectable class and plugin priority. Within those boundaries, remaining
  long-window quota and time to reset are combined as quota pressure.

`quota_endpoint` is restricted to the expected ChatGPT quota endpoint and cannot
be redirected to an arbitrary host.

## Model Retry Chain

The Management UI includes an optional retry chain for upstream capacity and
transport failures (adopted from doer-ee's Codex Fleet Manager, MIT). When
enabled, a streaming request that fails before content reaches the client can
move through configured fallback models. Retryable failures include HTTP 429,
500, 502, 503, 504, and 529, capacity/overload failures, and equivalent
transport failures; anything unrecognized fails closed, and a request whose
content already reached the client is never retried. Each retry attempt is
re-issued through the host, so the normal scheduler still selects the account
and usage feedback still applies.

Open the **Model Retry Chain** collapsible section in the sidebar. Each
requested model can have ordered model-only fallbacks; CPA resolves the
optional provider. Fallbacks are numbered independently for each requested
model.

Retry modes are **Live**, **Shadow** (record only, never retry), and **Always
retry all models**. Always Retry also covers models without a configured
chain; when no fallback exists, it retries the same model. Shadow and Always
Retry are mutually exclusive. The section also configures maximum attempts
(including the first attempt), silence/hold/chain timeouts, frame and byte
buffers, and whether encrypted reasoning is removed when switching models.

The section can check and repair the CPA prerequisites, but CPA must be
`v7.3.4` or newer. If values are wrong, it shows an inline comparison table
with current and recommended values; differences are marked in red. Nothing
changes until **Apply recommended settings** is selected. The repair
hot-reloads:

```yaml
request-retry: 3
codex:
  stream-bootstrap-buffering: true
  stream-bootstrap-timeout: "0"
streaming:
  bootstrap-retries: 1
```

Retry scheduler events are persisted in plugin logs and localized in English
and Chinese. The chain is disabled by default; enable it explicitly.

## Management UI

Open **Codex Scheduler** from CPA Management Center, or visit:

```text
/v0/resource/plugins/codex-quota-scheduler/status
```

The page provides:

- the production-ordered account queue and next-account preview;
- separate Account Queue, Settings, and Retry Chain pages rather than placing
  all settings in the middle column;
- separate CPA priority and plugin priority indicators;
- quota bars, reset times, availability reasons, and circuit state;
- scheduler settings with plain-language safety guidance;
- aliases, notes, tags, groups, and per-account plugin priority editing;
- quota refresh, log viewing/export, and configuration import/export;
- automatic loading and de-duplication of routable model IDs when opening the
  Retry Chain page; and
- English and Chinese interface switching.

The CPA plugin menu API accepts only one static label, so the registered
sidebar name is **Codex Scheduler** in every management UI language.

When embedded in CPA Management Center, the plugin initially follows CPA's
current language: Chinese locales use Chinese, while every other locale defaults
to English. A language explicitly selected inside the plugin is remembered and
takes precedence on later visits.

Protected data and actions require the CPA Management key. By default, the key
remains only in the current browser page session. The optional **Remember
management key in this browser** setting saves it unencrypted in browser local
storage and automatically reloads protected data on later visits. Enable this
only on a trusted device. The key is never saved to plugin state, exports, or
logs; clearing the checkbox removes the browser-stored copy.

## Privacy And Data Disclosure

The plugin runs inside CPA. It uses CPA host callbacks and plugin-owned CPA
Management API routes; it does not run an external service and does not send
data to the plugin author.

It may send authenticated requests using the Codex credentials already
configured in CPA to:

```text
GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage
GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/rate-limit-reset-credits
```

When reset-window activation is enabled, the plugin may also send the small
Codex activation request described above.

Local plugin state can contain scheduler settings, quota snapshots, operation
state, logs, aliases, notes, tags, and group names. Do not put secrets in notes,
aliases, tags, or group annotations. The Management UI avoids rendering access
tokens, authorization headers, cookies, and other credential fields.

Resource routes serve UI assets only. Account data and privileged operations use
Management routes and require the CPA Management key.

## Build
